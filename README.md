# Arduino Base
The goal of this repo is to serve as a go-to boilerplate for rapid Arduino prototyping. It holds SMM's most up-to-date Arduino-related libraries, and a boilerplate sketch for use to quickly build exhibit prototypes. The way you choose to use this repo is up to you, but two suggested ways are noted below.

### Compatibility
This has been tested with Arduino UNO R3 @ 115200 baud, Adafruit Metro Mini @ 115200 baud, and Inland Pro-Mini @ 9600 baud.
